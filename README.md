# Car Rental Agency

I will develop the following pages:

1. **Registration Pages:**
   - There will be separate registration pages for customers and me as the car rental agency.

2. **Login Pages:**
   - There can be either a single login page or separate login pages for customers and me as the car rental agency.

3. **Add New Cars Page:**
   - After I log in as the car rental agency, I will be able to add details of new cars available for rental.
   - The details I need to add include:
     - Vehicle model
     - Vehicle number
     - Seating capacity
     - Rent per day
   - Only I, as the car rental agency, will have access to this page.
   - I will also be able to edit the details of a particular car.

4. **Available Cars to Rent Page:**
   - There will be a page displaying all the available cars for rent.
   - The displayed details will include:
     - Vehicle model
     - Vehicle number
     - Seating capacity
     - Rent per day
   - Customers who are logged in will see a dropdown to input the number of days they want to rent a car and a start date.
   - There will be a 'Rent Car' button.
   - This page will be accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they are logged in or not.
   - When the 'Rent Car' button is clicked:
     - Only customers will be able to book the available car.
     - If a customer is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.
     - If I am logged in as the agency, I won't be allowed to book the available cars.

5. **Car Agency 'View Booked Cars' Page:**
   - I, as the car rental agency, will have access to a page where I can see the list of all customers who have booked a particular car that I added.

For the technology stack:

1. **Front-end:**
   - I will write the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JS.
   - I might use Bootstrap to make the design process smoother.

2. **Back-end:**
   - The backend will be written in either core PHP or the PHP CodeIgniter framework.
   - I will use MySQL as the database to store the necessary information.

3. **Database Design:**
   - I will design the database to store information about users, cars, and bookings.
   - There will be separate tables for customers and for the cars available for rent.
   - The cars table will store details such as vehicle model, vehicle number, seating capacity, and rent per day.
   - I will create a bookings table to keep track of which customer booked which car, along with the start date and rental duration.

4. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - I will implement user authentication for both customers and myself as the car rental agency.
   - Customers and I will have separate login pages, each with its own authentication process.
   - I will set up authorization checks to ensure that only I, as the agency, can access certain pages like adding new cars.
   - Customers will be authorized to rent cars and view available cars.

5. **Front-end Development:**
   - I will create user-friendly registration and login forms for customers and for myself as the agency.
   - The 'Add New Cars' page will have a form to input details of new cars, and I will ensure that only I can access and use this form.
   - The 'Available Cars to Rent' page will display car details to all users, and I will dynamically show additional input fields for customers when they're logged in and want to rent a car.

6. **Back-end Development:**
   - I will write PHP scripts to handle user registration and login processes separately for customers and for myself as the agency.
   - For the 'Add New Cars' functionality, I'll create PHP scripts to add car details to the database, ensuring proper authentication and authorization.
   - The 'Available Cars to Rent' page will retrieve car details from the database and manage the booking process. It will only allow customers to book cars if they're logged in.

7. **Interaction and Logic:**
   - When a customer clicks the 'Rent Car' button, I will implement the logic to check if they're logged in. If not, they will be redirected to the login page. If they are logged in, they can proceed to book the car for the specified duration.
   - For the 'View Booked Cars' page, I will create a function that fetches booking information from the database and displays it to me as the agency.

8. **Testing and Security:**
   - I will thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected and that security measures are in place.
   - Input validation and data sanitization will be implemented to prevent security vulnerabilities.
   - I will also implement secure password storage techniques for user accounts.

9. **Deployment and Maintenance:**
   - Once the application is ready, I will deploy it on a web server.
   - Regular maintenance will be performed to address any issues, apply updates, and ensure the system runs smoothly.

In conclusion, I am designing a comprehensive car rental system that caters to both customers and myself as the car rental agency. The system will have user authentication, separate registration and login processes, and distinct functionalities for different user roles. I will use HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP (core or CodeIgniter) for development, along with MySQL for the database. My goal is to create a secure, user-friendly, and efficient system for car rental services.
